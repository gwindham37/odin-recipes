        <p>A Chicago staple, this sandwich was invented by working class Italian immigrants to the windy city in the 1930s. New York has the Chopped Cheese, Philidelphia has the philly cheesesteak, and Chicago has the greatest of them all: the Italian Beef.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Gravy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 lb. beef fat trimmings</li>
                <li>4 cups water</li>
                <li>2 beef bouillon cubes (double size)</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Kitchen Bouquet Browning and Seasoning Sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>Pinch of MSG</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Rolls and Beef</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Turano, Gonnella, or Amoroso sandwich rolls</li>
                <li>1 lb. roast beef, London Broil or Italian style, sliced thin</li>
            </ul>    
        <h4>Topping</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Marconi hot giardiniera</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Render the beef fat by chopping it into small bits (about the size of peas) with a food processor. Be sure the fat is very cold--it will chop better. If you don't have a food processor, you can chop the fat by hand. Use a sharp knife and cut it as small as you can. Heat up the fat in a saut√© pan over medium heat until the bits are browned. Strain the solids from the fat and measure 1/4 cup of fat for the gravy.</li>
                <li>Make the beef gravy by combining all of the ingredients, including the beef fat, in a medium saucepan over medium heat. When the mixture begins to boil reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, then turn the heat to low.</li>
                <li>Make the sandwiches by heating up the rolls in the hot oven for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>For each sandwich, drop 1/4 pound of sliced beef (separate the slices) into the gravy for 2 minutes. Make sure the gravy isn't boiling. It should be around 180 degrees F. After the beef has soaked in the gravy, use tongs to arrange the beef on a warmed sandwich roll and top with your choice of hot giardiniera. Spoon on some extra gravy just before serving.</li>
